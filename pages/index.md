Hey there, I'm fzxu. I (am hoping to) write about coding, system design and all other technical stuffs that I know (or would like to explore) here. Any comments/discussions are greatly welcomed (please).

Here are some things that I've been working on lately:
- I bought [Turing Pi 2](https://turingpi.com/) a while ago, but recently just got all the parts ready (finally) so working on building a private cloud (homelab) with it.
- [blog](https://github.com/KevinXuxuxu/blog), a static blog generating tool which powers this website. Yes, it's still a working in progress.
- [OpenCoder](https://site.fzxu.me/opencoder) is an open-source light-weight "serverless" collaborative coding and execution site, powered by [codapi](https://codapi.org/) and [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/). I hacked it up during a long weekend and still tons of work ahead!

And here's a list of all my blogs so far:

# My (new) blog framework

Inspired by [death and gravity](https://death.andgravity.com/about#colophon), built with the following packages
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
- [Frozen Flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/)
- [Mistune](https://mistune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Pygments](https://pygments.org/)
- [Spectre](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/index.html)
- [utterances](https://utteranc.es/)

The author of death and gravity has open-sourced his site generator ([andgravity-generator](https://github.com/lemon24/andgravity-generator/)) which is most likely much better than mine. Building this project is a very rewarding learning experience, and I'll add some more traditional features for common blog site that's not covered by his tool.

### TODO
- ~~Dark mode~~
- ~~Tag/category support~~
- Better layout with header/footer and navigation
- ~~Flexible theme selection~~
- Status post (~~with twitter?~~ github issue?)
- ~~About page / Index page~~
